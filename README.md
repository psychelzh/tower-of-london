See similar project of [tolspace](https://sites.google.com/site/tolspace/). And these are also inspired by Berg and Byrd (2002).

The final task selection is based on Berg et al. (2010):

> We chose not to assess problems requiring one to three minimum moves since they are easily solved by most adults. In many research studies, discrimination among test conditions is poor for non-clinical adults for problems with fewer than four minimum moves. Though 8-move problems were included in the testing, data from these problems were not included in analyses because: (1) there are relatively few 8-move problems, (2) they are typically excluded from clinical and research batteries incorporating the TOL, and (3) in general, they are surprisingly easy to solve since they have many more optimal solution paths; almost half have 6 or 8 paths compared with a maximum of 3 paths for 4 to 7-move problems.
